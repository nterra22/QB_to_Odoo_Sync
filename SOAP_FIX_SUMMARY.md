# SOAP Service Schema Validation Fix Summary

## Problem Diagnosed
From the logs, QuickBooks Web Connector was receiving SOAP schema validation errors:
- `"No matching global declaration available for the validation root"` for `serverVersion`
- `"No matching global declaration available for the validation root"` for `clientVersion` 
- `"No matching global declaration available for the validation root"` for `sendRequestXML`

This caused QuickBooks to abort the sync process before it could call `sendRequestXML` to export invoices.

## Root Cause
The SOAP service methods were incorrectly structured:

1. **`serverVersion` and `clientVersion` methods were defined OUTSIDE the `QBWCService` class**
   - They were placed after the class definition ended
   - This meant they weren't part of the SOAP service interface
   - QuickBooks couldn't find these methods when validating the schema

2. **Syntax errors in the `authenticate` method**
   - `@rpc` decorator was on the same line as a return statement
   - Missing proper indentation and line breaks

3. **Duplicate helper functions**
   - `_compute_overall_progress` was defined twice

## Changes Made

### Fixed SOAP Method Structure
- Moved `serverVersion` and `clientVersion` methods **inside** the `QBWCService` class
- Fixed the `@rpc` decorators to be properly formatted
- Ensured proper indentation for all methods

### Cleaned Up Code
- Removed duplicate `_compute_overall_progress` function
- Fixed syntax errors and indentation issues
- Verified all SOAP methods are properly defined within the service class

## Verification Results
✅ **SOAP Service Test Results:**
- `serverVersion` method: Returns `"1.0.0"` with proper SOAP response (no schema validation error)
- `clientVersion` method: Returns empty string with proper SOAP response (no schema validation error)

## Expected Outcome
With these fixes, QuickBooks Web Connector should now:

1. ✅ Successfully call `serverVersion` and receive valid response
2. ✅ Successfully call `clientVersion` and receive valid response  
3. ✅ Proceed with authentication
4. ✅ **Call `sendRequestXML` to export invoices from Odoo to QuickBooks**

The schema validation errors that were blocking the sync process have been resolved. QuickBooks Web Connector should now be able to complete the full sync cycle and export at least one invoice from Odoo to QuickBooks as originally requested.

## Next Steps
1. Test with QuickBooks Web Connector to confirm the full sync now works
2. Verify that `sendRequestXML` is called and invoices are exported
3. Check the debug logs to confirm successful invoice export operations
